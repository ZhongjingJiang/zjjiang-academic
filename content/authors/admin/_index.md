Hello！ My name is Zhongjing Jiang (姜中景). I am a postdoctoral scholar at Environmental and Climate Sciences Department, Brookhaven National Laboratory. My research interests include chemistry-climate interaction, atmospheric modeling, air quality, and climate change. I am familar with atmospheric chemistry transport models like GEOS-Chem and WRF-Chem as well as earth system model CESM. Currently, my research mainly focus on tropospheric ozone and aerosol. Welcome discussion about atmospheric and climate issues!

你好！我是姜中景，目前是布鲁克海文国家实验室的一名博士后。我的研究方向是大气化学-气候相互作用，研究主要关注对流层臭氧和气溶胶，对各种模式很感兴趣，熟悉大气化学传输模式GEOS-Chem和WRF-Chem以及地球系统模式CESM，此外，我对气候变化领域的问题很感兴趣。请大家多多指教！
